Question:
Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might
become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
Find the minimum element.
The array may contain duplicates.

"""
O(log n) runtime, O(1) space

For case where Al == Am == Ar, the minimum could be on Amâ€™s left or right side (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] or 
[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). In this case, we could not discard either subarrays and therefore such worst case degenerates to the 
order of O(n).
