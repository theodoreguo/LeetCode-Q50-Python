Question:
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome. "race a car" is not a palindrome.

Example Questions Candidate Might Ask:
Q: What about an empty string? Is it a valid palindrome?
A: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
"""

"""
The idea is simple, have two pointers â€“ one at the head while the other one at the tail. 
Move them towards each other until they meet while skipping non-alphanumeric characters.
Consider the case where given string contains only non-alphanumeric characters. 
This is a valid palindrome because the empty string is also a valid palindrome.
